Title: Egg Catcher Game

Description:
The Egg Catcher game is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a catcher at the bottom of the screen and tries to catch falling eggs before they hit the ground. The player earns points for each egg caught and loses a life for each egg that reaches the bottom without being caught. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.

Features:

Catcher Control: The player can move the catcher left and right using the keyboard arrow keys to position it under falling eggs.
Egg Dropping: Eggs drop from the top of the screen at regular intervals.
Scoring: Each successfully caught egg earns the player a certain number of points.
Lives: The player starts with a certain number of lives. Losing an egg reduces the number of lives remaining.
Difficulty Levels: The speed of the falling eggs increases as the game progresses, making it more challenging.
Technologies:

Python: Used for game logic and event handling.
Tkinter: Python's built-in GUI library for creating the game window and graphics.
Random module: Used to generate random positions and colors for the falling eggs.
Font module: Used to customize the font style and size for displaying score and lives remaining.
Tkinter messagebox: Used to display a game-over message when the player loses all lives.
